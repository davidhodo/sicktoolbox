The Sick LIDAR Matlab/C++ Toolbox
-------------------------------------------------------------------

***INSTALLATION

The toolbox is configured w/ GNU Autotools and thus can be build
and installed using the normal three step process. Additionally,
all standard make file targets are present. In short, follow these
steps:

- C++ Libraries:

  To install the toolbox C++ libraries do the following from the
  project's root:

    ./configure
    make
    make install (Note: This step must be done as admin/root)

  This sequence of steps will build and install the libraries w/
  headers necessary for building C++ code. As installation will
  copy files to /usr/local/bin make install must be run as admin

- Matlab Mex Interface:

  To build the mex interface do the following:
  NOTE: If the C++ libs are installed no need to do ./configure
        (Step 1) again

    ./configure (Note: This generates the header for C++ libs) 
    cd matlab
    ./config_mex
    ./build_mex
    ./install_mex (Note: This step must be done as admin/root)

***UNINSTALLATION

- C++ Libraries

  To uninstall the C++ libraries, simply run "make uninstall" from
  the project's root.

- Matlab Mex Interface

  To uninstall the mex interface, simply delete the directory
  $MATLABROOT/toolbox/sick and remove it from your Matlab path.
  Here $MATLABROOT references Matlab's root directory.
